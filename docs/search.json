Topics include structured programming and algorithm development, flow control, simple and advanced data input-output and representation, functions and objects, documentation, testing and debugging. The course will be taught using a combination of the R and Python programming languages.\nBy the end of EDS 221, students should be able to:\n\nUnderstand, create, and work with different data structures (e.g. vectors, data frames, lists) and types (e.g. numeric, character, factor, logical, date-times)\nDesign, implement, test, and document functions, including functions with iteration, conditionals, messages, and warnings in R\nUse basic (non-collaborative) project-oriented workflos with reproducible code (R scripts, Quarto documents, Jupyter notebooks) and version control (git/GitHub basics)\nPerform basic data wrangling and visualization with real world environmental data and tidyverse packages (in R)\nEmploy troubleshooting and debugging strategies including tools, mindsets, strategies, and resources"
